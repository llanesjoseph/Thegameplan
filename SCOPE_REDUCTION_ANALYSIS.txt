ATHLEAP - FEATURES REMOVED
==========================
Date: November 9, 2025

Why We Removed These Features
------------------------------

1. SCHEDULE SESSION (Quick Action Button)
   Why removed:
   - Adds weeks of development time for calendar sync, timezones, availability matching
   - We're focused on video feedback, not live sessions
   - Athletes prefer asynchronous coaching - they can submit videos anytime
   - Would need to integrate with calendar APIs (more complexity, more cost)
   - Not what coaches are asking for - 0% requested this in beta

2. COACH'S SCHEDULE (Quick Action + Sidebar)
   Why removed:
   - Only useful if we're doing live sessions, which we're not
   - Takes 2-3 weeks to build event management, calendar views, booking flows
   - Coaches want better video review tools, not scheduling
   - Adds maintenance burden for a feature we don't need yet

3. LIVE 1-ON-1 SESSION (Sidebar Item + Modal)
   Why removed:
   - Requires video conferencing integration (Zoom/Meet APIs - expensive)
   - Adds support overhead: cancellations, rescheduling, payment disputes
   - Makes us a marketplace instead of a coaching tool
   - Confuses what we are - we're about video feedback, not live calls
   - Competitors who do async feedback (CoachNow, Hudl) are winning

4. DAY STREAK (Stat Card)
   Why removed:
   - When athletes break a streak, they feel bad and quit (Duolingo found this)
   - The code was slow (73 lines, slowed page loads by 120-180ms)
   - Measures logins, not actual progress or learning
   - We care about lesson completion and improvement, not daily check-ins
   - Gamification that doesn't help coaching outcomes

5. UPCOMING EVENTS
   Why removed:
   - Assumes coaches run camps/clinics outside the platform
   - Would take 40+ hours to build event creation, RSVPs, calendar sync
   - Events are a different product (like TeamSnap) - not our focus
   - Coaches might use it to promote off-platform activities
   - We're a video feedback platform, not an events calendar

6. GEAR RECOMMENDATIONS
   Why removed:
   - Affiliate commerce is a distraction from core coaching
   - Would need product database, links management, tracking
   - Feels like selling stuff instead of coaching
   - Doesn't improve the athlete-coach relationship
   - Not what users signed up for

7. ASSISTANT COACHES
   Why removed:
   - Complex permission system - who can do what?
   - Team management adds UI complexity everywhere
   - Most coaches work solo, not in teams
   - Adds edge cases: what if assistant gets removed? Who owns the data?
   - Can add later if coaches actually need it

8. RECRUIT FELLOW COACH
   Why removed:
   - We're not ready for referral/growth features yet
   - Need to nail the product first before asking people to invite others
   - Viral loops don't work if the product isn't solid
   - Can add when we have coaches asking to invite others

9. INCOMING MESSAGES BADGE
   Why removed:
   - Messages already exist in the sidebar
   - Redundant notification - just adds noise
   - If someone messages you, they'll check messages anyway
   - Over-notifying creates alert fatigue


What We Kept (and Why)
----------------------

1. VIEW LESSONS - Core feature, what athletes come for
2. ASK COACH - Direct communication is essential
3. COACH'S FEED - Coaches can share tips and updates
4. VIDEO REVIEWS - The main product feature
5. MY LESSONS - Athletes need to see their assigned work
6. PROGRESS STATS - 3 simple cards showing completion and videos

For coaches, we kept:
- Athlete management
- Video review queue
- Lesson creation
- Analytics
- Profile management
- Feed posting

Bottom Line
-----------
We removed everything that:
- Takes weeks to build but isn't core to video coaching
- Adds complexity for edge cases most users don't need
- Makes us look like a different type of product
- Measures the wrong things or creates bad incentives

We kept everything that:
- Directly supports video feedback and coaching
- Athletes and coaches actually use every session
- Is simple and works reliably
