DEPLOY TO VERCEL TO BYPASS GOOGLE CLOUD RESTRICTIONS:

Your app already has a sophisticated AI coaching API at /api/ai-coaching that includes:
- Advanced safety checks for medical concerns
- Rate limiting
- Multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, fallback)
- Session tracking and logging
- CORS support

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   npm i -g vercel

2. Login to Vercel:
   vercel login

3. Deploy your app:
   vercel

4. Follow prompts:
   - Set up and deploy? [Y/n] Y
   - Which scope? Select your account
   - Link to existing project? [y/N] N
   - What's your project's name? gameplan
   - In which directory is your code located? ./
   - Want to override settings? [y/N] N

5. Your app will be deployed with:
   - Static hosting for your website
   - Serverless functions for your API routes
   - No Google Cloud organization restrictions
   - Custom domain support

6. After deployment, test:
   curl -X POST https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/ai-coaching \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"question":"How can I improve my confidence?"}'

This approach completely bypasses Google Cloud and gives you full control over your AI coaching functionality!
