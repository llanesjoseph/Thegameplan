```

---

### Environment Variables

### If Issues Detected

**Immediate rollback (< 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Rollback Vercel deployment
vercel promote [previous-deployment-url] --prod

git checkout HEAD~1 firestore.rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project gameplan-787a2
```

**Partial rollback:**
- Feature flags to disable new features
