## üìä **ATHLETE FLOW**

### **Flow Overview**
```
Upload Video ‚Üí View Reviews List ‚Üí Click Submission ‚Üí Watch Video & See Feedback ‚Üí [Optional] Delete
```

### **Step 1: Upload Video**
**Page:** `/dashboard/athlete/get-feedback`  
**Component:** `app/dashboard/athlete/get-feedback/page.tsx`

**Process:**
1. Athlete clicks "Get Feedback" from dashboard
2. Fills out submission form:
   - Skill Name (what they're working on)
   - Context (description)
   - Goals (what they want to improve)
   - Specific Questions (optional)
3. Uploads video file

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Firebase Storage client SDK (`firebase/storage`)
- Storage path: `/uploads/{userId}/submissions/{submissionId}/{filename}`
- Generates thumbnail automatically
- Creates Firestore document in `submissions` collection
- Status: `awaiting_coach`

**Storage Config:** `lib/firebase.client.ts`
```typescript
storageBucket: "gameplan-787a2.appspot.com" // ‚úÖ FIXED - was .firebasestorage.app
```

**API Endpoint:** `/api/submissions/[id]/upload-complete`
- Updates submission with video URL and metadata
- Sets status to `awaiting_coach`

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ User must be authenticated
- ‚úÖ Can only upload to their own folder
- ‚úÖ File type validation (video/* only)
- ‚úÖ File size limit: 500MB

---

### **Step 2: View Reviews List**
**Page:** `/dashboard/athlete/reviews`  
**Component:** `app/dashboard/athlete/reviews/page.tsx`

**Process:**
1. Athlete navigates to "Video Reviews" from dashboard
2. System fetches all submissions for this athlete
3. Displays list with:
   - Skill name
   - Submission date
   - Status badge (awaiting_coach, in_review, complete)
   - Thumbnail preview
   - Context excerpt

**API Endpoint:** `/api/submissions` (GET)
- Fetches submissions where `athleteUid == user.uid`
- Sorted by `createdAt` DESC (in-memory)
- Returns array of submissions with metadata

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/api/submissions/route.ts
const query = adminDb.collection('submissions').where('athleteUid', '==', userId);
const snapshot = await query.get();
let submissions = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
  id: doc.id,
  ...doc.data(),
  createdAt: data.createdAt?.toDate?.()?.toISOString()
}));
// Sort in memory to avoid composite index
submissions.sort((a, b) => bDate - aDate);
```

**UI Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Clickable cards** - Each submission is wrapped in `<Link>` component
- ‚úÖ **Status indicators** - Color-coded badges
- ‚úÖ **Responsive grid** - Adapts to screen size
- ‚úÖ **Empty state** - Shows helpful message when no submissions

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ Server-side API with authentication
- ‚úÖ Only returns submissions owned by authenticated user
- ‚úÖ Uses Firebase Admin SDK for secure queries

---

### **Step 3: Click Submission & View Detail**
**Page:** `/dashboard/athlete/reviews/[submissionId]`  
**Component:** `app/dashboard/athlete/reviews/[submissionId]/page.tsx`

**Process:**
1. Athlete clicks a submission card
2. Navigates to detail page
3. Sees:
   - Video player with their submission
   - Their submission details (context, goals, questions)
   - Coach feedback (if complete)
   - Comments section

**API Endpoint:** `/api/submissions/[id]` (GET)
- Fetches single submission with ID
- Includes review data if status is 'complete'
- Includes all comments

**Video Player Implementation:**
```tsx
<video 
  controls 
  className="w-full h-full" 
  src={submission.videoUrl || submission.videoDownloadUrl} 
  poster={submission.thumbnailUrl}
  onError={(e) => {
    console.error('‚ùå Video failed to load:', videoUrl);
    // Shows user-friendly error with link to open in new tab
  }}
  onLoadStart={() => console.log('‚úÖ Video loading started')}
  onCanPlay={() => console.log('‚úÖ Video can play')}
>
```

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ Server-side verification that user owns submission
- ‚úÖ Returns 403 if user tries to access others' submissions
- ‚úÖ Firebase Storage rules allow authenticated read for uploads

**Storage Rules:** `storage.rules`
```javascript
match /uploads/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();  // All authenticated users can read
  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow delete: if request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin();
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Delete Submission (Optional)**
**Feature:** Delete button appears on submission detail page  
**API Endpoint:** `/api/submissions/[id]/delete` (DELETE)

**Conditions:**
- Only shows for submissions with status: `pending`, `draft`, or `awaiting_coach`
- Cannot delete if submission is claimed or in review
- Cannot delete if review is complete

**Process:**
1. Athlete clicks "Delete" button
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. On confirm:
   - Deletes video file from Firebase Storage
   - Deletes thumbnail from Firebase Storage
   - Deletes Firestore document
   - Redirects to reviews list

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/api/submissions/[id]/delete/route.ts
export async function DELETE(request, { params }) {
  // 1. Verify authentication
  // 2. Get submission and check ownership
  // 3. Check status allows deletion
  // 4. Delete files from Storage
  // 5. Delete Firestore document
}
```

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ User must own the submission
- ‚úÖ Status must be deletable
- ‚úÖ Storage deletion uses Admin SDK
- ‚úÖ Atomic Firestore deletion

## üêõ **Known Issues & Fixes**

### **FIXED: Storage Bucket Error**
**Issue:** Videos failed to load with "NoSuchBucket" error  
**Cause:** Config used `gameplan-787a2.firebasestorage.app` but actual bucket is `gameplan-787a2.appspot.com`  
**Fix:** Updated `lib/firebase.client.ts` and `lib/firebase-env.ts`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **FIXED: React Error #310**
**Issue:** Component unmounted immediately after rendering  
**Cause:** Conditional hook calls in `useEffect`  
**Fix:** Ensured hooks called unconditionally at top of effect  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **FIXED: Iframe Redirect Loop**
**Issue:** Video reviews page crashed when embedded in parent dashboard  
**Cause:** Parent dashboard checked roles and redirected, causing reviews component to unmount  
**Fix:** Changed video reviews navigation from iframe to direct link  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### **FIXED: Firestore Composite Index**
**Issue:** Query failed due to missing composite index for `where` + `orderBy`  
**Cause:** Combining `where('athleteUid', '==', userId)` with `orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`  
**Fix:** Removed `orderBy` from query, implemented in-memory sorting  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
