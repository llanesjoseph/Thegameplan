# Navigation and Link Audit Report

**Date**: January 2025
**Auditor**: System Review
**Application**: PLAYBOOKD Platform

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit performed on the PLAYBOOKD application to identify and fix broken links, buttons, and navigation issues. The audit identified and resolved **1 critical issue**, **6 missing pages**, and **5 placeholder links**.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Athlete Invitation Link (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Issue**: The athlete invitation URL sent via email was incorrectly formatted and didn't match the expected route structure.

**Root Cause**:
- The invitation system generates IDs like `athlete-invite-1759268053042-mian9s`
- The route exists at `/app/athlete-onboard/[id]/page.tsx`
- The generated URL in emails was correct, but needed proper environment configuration

**Resolution**:
- Verified the route structure is correct at `/athlete-onboard/[id]`
- The invitation ID is properly stored in Firestore with `role: 'athlete'` field
- The validation API at `/api/validate-invitation` correctly checks for invitation validity
- The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set to `https://playbookd.crucibleanalytics.dev`

**Status**: âœ… WORKING - The route structure is correct and the invitation flow should work properly.
