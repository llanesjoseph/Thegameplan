**Correction method:** Establish strong grips before initiating sweep

**Coaching cue:** *"Grips first, then sweep - never rush the setup"*

#### ‚ùå Using only arm strength for sweep

**Why this happens:** Inefficient and easily defended

**Correction method:** Use hip movement and leverage, not arm strength

**Coaching cue:** *"Hips drive the sweep, arms just guide"*

#### ‚ùå Poor timing - sweeping when opponent is stable

**Why this happens:** Opponent can easily counter or resist

**Correction method:** Wait for opponent movement or create off-balance

**Coaching cue:** *"Feel their weight shift, then sweep"*
