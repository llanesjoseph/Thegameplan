## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. **SUBMISSION SYSTEM DATA CORRUPTION**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Video submissions not functioning properly

**Issues Found:**
- All 6 submissions are missing `athleteId` and `videoUrl` fields
- Submissions show status as "complete" but lack essential data
- This explains why video reviews aren't working properly

**Affected Submissions:**
- `1FGS1s32UykKyxiYRoph`
- `QCbULE7I1lr9E2nS5RiN`
- `b42Jho9MrpWb1vLifEpf`
- `qQkI3TTOT5kwVoLNWfpo`
- `ruq4KUqO3cpu8ai9rhRd`
- `tWP34dv6IQnEdgZ2V1nY`

**Recommended Action:** 
- Investigate submission creation process
- Check video upload functionality
- Verify athlete ID assignment during submission

### 2. **CONTENT SYSTEM MISSING TYPE FIELD**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Lesson content not properly categorized

**Issues Found:**
- All 22 content items are missing the `type` field
- Content shows as "undefined" type
- This affects lesson categorization and filtering

**Affected Content Items:** 22 items (all content in database)

**Recommended Action:**
- Add `type` field to all content items
- Implement content type validation
- Update content creation process

### 3. **INVITATION SYSTEM EMAIL ADDRESS ISSUES**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Invitation system partially broken

**Issues Found:**
- 10 out of 13 invitations missing `athleteEmail` field
- Only 3 invitations have valid email addresses
- This affects invitation delivery and tracking

**Affected Invitations:** 10 invitations

**Recommended Action:**
- Fix invitation creation process
- Ensure email addresses are captured
- Implement email validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è API ENDPOINT ISSUES

### API Status Codes Analysis:
- `/api/coach/messages`: Returns 400 (Bad Request) - Expected 200 or 401
- `/api/coach/reply-message`: Returns 405 (Method Not Allowed) - Expected 200 or 401
- `/api/athlete/contact-coach`: Returns 405 (Method Not Allowed) - Expected 200 or 401
- `/api/athlete/sync-lessons`: Returns 405 (Method Not Allowed) - Expected 200 or 401
- `/api/athlete/progress`: Returns 401 (Unauthorized) - ‚úÖ CORRECT
- `/api/generate-lesson`: Returns 405 (Method Not Allowed) - Expected 200 or 401
- `/api/coach-profile/jasmine-aikey--coach`: Returns 200 - ‚úÖ CORRECT

**Analysis:** Most API endpoints are returning 405 (Method Not Allowed) when tested with GET requests, which suggests they require POST requests or have authentication issues.
