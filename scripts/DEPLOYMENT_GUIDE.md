# 🚀 Game Plan Platform - Security Rules Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Before You Deploy**

Your current Firestore rules are **OPEN** and allow any authenticated user to read/write everything. The new rules are **STRICT** and will require proper user roles and permissions.

### **🔍 Current vs New Rules**

**CURRENT (DANGEROUS):**
```javascript
// Allows ANY authenticated user to read/write EVERYTHING
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

**NEW (SECURE):**
```javascript
// Strict role-based access control
// Users can only access their own data
// Creators can only manage their content
// Admins have appropriate elevated access
```

## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### **1. Set Up Your Superadmins First**
Before deploying, ensure your superadmins are properly set up:

```bash
# Run the superadmin setup script
node scripts/browser-setup-all-superadmins.js
```

**Required superadmins:**
- `joseph@crucibleanalytics.dev`
- `LonaLorraine.Vincent@gmail.com`
- `merlinesaintil@gmail.com`

### **2. Test Current Application**
- [ ] Verify all current features work
- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Test creator dashboard access
- [ ] Test admin panel access
- [ ] Test file uploads
- [ ] Test content creation

### **3. Backup Current Rules**
The deployment script will automatically backup your current rules, but manual backup is recommended:

```bash
cp firestore.rules firestore.rules.backup.manual
cp storage.rules storage.rules.backup.manual
```

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)**

**For Windows:**
```bash
scripts/deploy-security-rules.bat
```

**For Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy-security-rules.sh
./scripts/deploy-security-rules.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Deployment**

```bash
# 1. Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project gameplan-787a2

# 2. Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage --project gameplan-787a2

# 3. Deploy indexes (optional)
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes --project gameplan-787a2
```

### **Option 3: Firebase Console**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/gameplan-787a2)
2. Navigate to Firestore → Rules
3. Copy contents of `firestore.rules` and paste
4. Click "Publish"
5. Repeat for Storage → Rules using `storage.rules`

- [ ] Creators cannot access admin features

### **3. Test Admin Access**
- [ ] Admins can access admin panel

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "Permission denied" errors**
**Cause:** User doesn't have proper role assigned
**Solution:** 
1. Check user's role in Firestore `users` collection
2. Ensure user has `role` field set correctly
3. Use superadmin to fix user roles

### **Issue: Creator dashboard not accessible**
**Cause:** User role is not 'creator' or creator status is not 'approved'
**Solution:**
1. Check `users/{userId}` document
2. Ensure `role: 'creator'` is set
3. Ensure `creatorStatus: 'approved'` is set

### **Issue: File uploads failing**
**Cause:** Storage rules blocking upload
**Solution:**
1. Check file type is allowed
2. Check file size is within limits
3. Check user has proper permissions for upload path

### **Issue: Admin panel not accessible**
**Cause:** User doesn't have admin role
**Solution:**
1. Set user role to 'admin' or 'superadmin'
2. Ensure role is set in Firestore `users` collection

---

## 🔧 **Emergency Rollback**

If something goes wrong, you can rollback to the previous rules:

```bash
# Restore from backup
cp firestore.rules.backup.manual firestore.rules
cp storage.rules.backup.manual storage.rules

# Deploy backup rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project gameplan-787a2
firebase deploy --only storage --project gameplan-787a2
```

---

## 📊 **Monitoring After Deployment**

### **1. Check Firebase Console**
- Monitor Firestore usage
- Check for permission denied errors
- Review Storage usage

### **2. Monitor Application Logs**
```bash
# Check Firebase Functions logs
firebase functions:log --project gameplan-787a2

# Check for security events
firebase firestore:rules:test --project gameplan-787a2
```

### **3. Test User Flows**
- [ ] New user registration
- [ ] Creator application process
- [ ] Content creation workflow
- [ ] Admin user management
- [ ] File upload/download

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All existing users can access their data
- [ ] Creators can manage their content
- [ ] Admins can access admin features
- [ ] Superadmins have full access
- [ ] File uploads work with proper limits
- [ ] No unauthorized access is possible
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved

---

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the backup files** - Your old rules are safely backed up
2. **Review the security rules** - Understand what changed
3. **Test with superadmin account** - Use elevated privileges to fix issues
4. **Rollback if necessary** - Don't hesitate to revert if critical issues arise

**Remember:** The new rules are much more secure but also more restrictive. Some functionality may need to be updated in your application code to work with the new security model.
