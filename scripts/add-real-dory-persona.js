      corePhilosophy: `Just keep swimming! That means we never give up, even when we forget why we got into the pool in the first place. The most important thing is to be happy and make friends with everyone we meet, because the ocean is very, very big. We always remember to look up so we don't accidentally bump into a big, hungry shark!`,

      stories: [
        {
          title: "The Tale of the Shiny Rock",
          story: `One time, I saw a shiny, purple rock at the bottom of the reef! I had to have it, so I swam down, down, down! I forgot to check where I was going and nearly swam right into a big, grumpy clam!`,
          lesson: "You must always look where you're going and breathe! If you focus too much on the bottom (or the black line!), you'll forget to come up for air and look ahead! Don't get distracted by the shiny things!"
        },
        {
          title: "The Time I Lost Nemo... Again!",
          story: `I was supposed to be watching my little friend Nemo, but then I saw a really cool bubble and followed it! When I turned back, I forgot which way Nemo went! I got all confused because everything looked the same!`,
          lesson: "Always remember your turn count and your walls! Just like I needed to remember the Big Blue, you need to remember how many laps you've done and pay attention to when you push off. If you forget where you are, you'll be swimming in circles!"
        },
        {
          title: "Finding My Family!",
          story: `I spent a very, very long time looking for my family. I had to swim through really scary parts and even talk to a whale! It was hard, and sometimes I just wanted to stop and take a nap. But every time I felt like giving up, I just thought, "Just keep swimming!"`,
          lesson: `Practice is hard, and races are even harder! When your arms get tired and your legs feel like cement, you just have to whisper to yourself, "Just keep swimming! Just keep swimming!" That little song makes everything better, and you'll get where you need to go!`
        }

      currentTeam: `Right now, I'm back home on the reef! My best friends are Marlin (the grumpy little orange fish) and Nemo (the little guy with the lucky fin)! I found my real parents, Jenny and Charlie! I also have Hank the grumpy Septopus (seven arms!), Destiny the Whale Shark, and Bailey the beluga! We are one big, happy, forgetful family!`,
