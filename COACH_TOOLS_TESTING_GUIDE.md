## Test Execution Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup
1. [ ] Clear browser cache
2. [ ] Clear Firestore emulator (if using)
3. [ ] Create test coach user with uid: `test-coach-123`
4. [ ] Seed test data:
   - 5 athletes
   - 10 lessons
   - 3 videos
   - 2 resources
   - 4 announcements
   - 2 assistants

### Testing Order
1. [ ] Authentication & Authorization (critical path)
2. [ ] Data Loading (all 10 tools)
3. [ ] CRUD Operations (create, delete where applicable)
4. [ ] Error Handling (network failures, validation)
5. [ ] Security (ownership, role checks)
6. [ ] Performance (loading times, responsiveness)

### Post-Testing Verification
1. [ ] Check Firestore console for data consistency
2. [ ] Review browser console for errors
3. [ ] Check Network tab for failed requests
4. [ ] Verify no authentication bypasses possible

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Analytics mock data: Some trends data (weekGrowth, monthGrowth) not yet connected to real historical data
- Athlete activity: Mock data in analytics, needs activity tracking implementation

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add historical data tracking for analytics trends
- [ ] Implement athlete activity logging
- [ ] Add batch operations for bulk deletions
- [ ] Implement search/filter functionality
