## Step 3: Deploy Firestore Security Rules (30 seconds)
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**What you'll see:**
```
=== Deploying to 'gameplan-787a2'...

i deploying firestore
i firestore: reading rules firestore.rules...

```

**Expected output:**

## ✅ THAT'S IT! You're Done!

### What Just Happened:

1. ✅ **Cloud Functions deployed** - Now listening for lesson publishes and athlete assignments
2. ✅ **Security rules deployed** - New collections (coach_rosters, athlete_feed) are protected
3. ✅ **Your existing data is already migrated** - 1 coach, 1 athlete, 4 lessons ready to go

### What Works NOW:

- **Publish a lesson as Joseph** → Athlete gets it in <3 seconds
- **Assign new athlete to Joseph** → They get all 4 lessons automatically
- **Athlete marks lesson complete** → Progress tracks automatically

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test the system right now:

1. **In Firebase Console** (https://console.firebase.google.com):
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Navigate to `athlete_feed` → `{athleteId}`
   - You should see `availableLessons: [4 lesson IDs]`

2. **Publish a test lesson**:
   - Go to `content` collection
   - Add new document with:
     - `title: "Test Lesson"`
     - `creatorUid: "OQuvoho6w3NC9QTBLFSoIK7A2RQ2"` (Joseph's ID)
     - `status: "published"`
     - `description: "Testing automated delivery"`

3. **Wait 3 seconds**, then check:
   - `athlete_feed/{athleteId}` → `availableLessons` should now have 5 lessons
   - `totalLessons` should be 5

---

## 📊 Monitor Functions

```bash
# Watch function logs in real-time
firebase functions:log --only onLessonPublished

# If you just published a test lesson, you should see:
# ✅ Lesson {lessonId} was just published. Delivering to athletes...
# ✅ Delivered lesson {lessonId} to 1 athletes
```
