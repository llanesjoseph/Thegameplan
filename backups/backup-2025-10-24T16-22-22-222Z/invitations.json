We must train the whole self.' We started with walking, then a slow shuffle. Focus on the joy of movement, not the speed of the run. Years, it took. But a Master he became. He won no medals, but running again, he was. The greatest comeback? The victory over one's own despair it is.\""

I asked. 'No, Master,' he replied. 'Then why are your legs heavy?' I asked. 'The weight you carry is not in your muscles, but in your mind. It is the weight of doubt. Drop the doubt, and light your stride will become.' From that day, a much lighter runner he was.\""
