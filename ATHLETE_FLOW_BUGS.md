## 🚨 CRITICAL BUGS (P1)

### Bug #1: Athletes Not Receiving Password Setup Email
**Status:** CRITICAL - Blocks athlete login
**Location:** `app/api/submit-athlete/route.ts:233`
**Impact:** Athletes complete onboarding but receive no credentials to log in

**Details:**
- Password reset link is generated (line 231) but never sent via email
- TODO comment on line 233: "Send this link via email service with welcome message"
- Athletes see success message "Check your email for instructions to set your password" (line 245)
- But NO email is actually sent - they have no way to log in
- Temporary password is generated but athlete doesn't know it (line 88)

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Line 229-236 in app/api/submit-athlete/route.ts
try {
  const resetLink = await auth.generatePasswordResetLink(athleteProfile.email?.toLowerCase())
  console.log(`Password reset link generated for ${athleteProfile.email}`)
  // TODO: Send this link via email service with welcome message  // ❌ EMAIL NOT SENT!
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to generate password reset link:', error)
}
```

**Root Cause:**
- Email sending logic was never implemented
- Only generates link but doesn't use email service
- Return message falsely claims email will be sent

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Import Resend email service (already used in other files)
2. Create athlete welcome email template with password reset link
3. Send email after generating reset link
4. Handle email failures gracefully

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (P2)

### Issue #1: Misleading Success Message
**Location:** `app/api/submit-athlete/route.ts:245`
**Current Message:** "Check your email for instructions to set your password."
**Problem:** Athletes will check email but find nothing, causing confusion

**Recommended Fix:** Update message to match actual flow or fix email sending

---

### Issue #2: Hardcoded Sports List in Athlete Onboarding
**Location:** `app/athlete-onboard/[id]/page.tsx:37-41`
**Problem:** Sports list is hardcoded with only 12 sports, while global constant has 15

**Current Code:**
```typescript
const SPORTS_LIST = [
  'Soccer', 'Basketball', 'Baseball', 'Tennis', 'Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu',
  'Running', 'Volleyball', 'Swimming', 'American Football', 'Golf',
  'Boxing', 'Track & Field'  // ❌ Missing: Wrestling, Softball, Other
]
```

**Global Constant:** `lib/constants/sports.ts` has 15 sports
**Impact:** Athletes can't select Wrestling, Softball, or Other as primary sport

**Recommended Fix:** Import and use `SPORTS` from `@/lib/constants/sports`
