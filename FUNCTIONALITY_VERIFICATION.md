  - `coachCredentials`
  - `expertise`
  - `personalityTraits`
  - `responseStyle` (greeting, encouragement, signatureClosing, personalStoryIntros)

**Verification:**
- ✅ All sport contexts have complete CoachingContext structure
- ✅ Basketball context: Complete ✅
- ✅ Tennis context: Complete ✅
- ✅ Baseball context: Complete ✅
- ✅ Hockey context: Complete ✅
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing contexts

### 4. ✅ `lib/data-consistency.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added `as any` type assertions for `serverTimestamp()` calls
- Pattern: `createdAt: serverTimestamp() as any`

**Verification:**
- ✅ Firestore operations work correctly
- ✅ Type assertions resolve FieldValue/Timestamp mismatch
- ✅ Standard Firestore pattern for server timestamps

**Functionality Impact:** NONE - Standard Firestore type workaround

---

### 5. ✅ `lib/voice-capture-service.ts`
**Changes:**
- Fixed property path: `rawData.philosophy?.communicationStyle` (was incorrectly in voiceCharacteristics)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Correctly reads from `philosophy` object
- ✅ Matches `VoiceCaptureData` interface structure
- ✅ Voice profile processing works correctly

**Functionality Impact:** FIXED - Was reading from wrong property before

---

### 6. ✅ `types/index.ts`
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import type { AppRole, CreatorProfile } from './user'`
- Changed `role: UserRole` to `role: AppRole` in interfaces
- Fixed circular reference issue

**Verification:**
- ✅ Type exports working correctly
- ✅ AppRole properly imported and used
- ✅ UserRole correctly exported as alias
- ✅ No circular dependency issues

**Functionality Impact:** NONE - Type system correction

---

### 7. ✅ `components/ui/AppHeader.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added optional props: `title?: string`, `subtitle?: string`
- Added rendering logic for title/subtitle with border separator

**Verification:**
- ✅ Component compiles successfully
- ✅ Props properly optional (backwards compatible)
- ✅ Renders title/subtitle when provided
- ✅ Works without title/subtitle (existing usage)

**Functionality Impact:** ENHANCED - Added new optional feature
