## 🎯 ROUTING RULES (100% Enforced)

| User Role | Dashboard Route | GUARANTEED |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| `athlete` | `/dashboard/progress` | ✅ Always |
| `coach` | `/dashboard/coach-unified` | ✅ Always |
| `creator` | `/dashboard/coach-unified` | ✅ Always |
| `assistant` | `/dashboard/coach-unified` | ✅ Always |
| `admin` | `/dashboard/admin` | ✅ Always |
| `superadmin` | `/dashboard/admin` | ✅ Always |
| `user` | `/dashboard/coach-unified` | ✅ Always (safe default) |
| Unknown | `/dashboard/coach-unified` | ✅ Always (safe default) |

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE

### SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

This is the **ONLY** place with routing logic. All other dashboard pages just render content.

### How It Works

1. **User navigates to `/dashboard`**
2. **System fetches role DIRECTLY from Firestore**
   - No hooks, no race conditions
   - Direct `getDoc(db, 'users', uid)` call
   - Waits for actual role to load
3. **Validates role is REAL**
   - Not `null`
   - Not `undefined`
   - Not `'guest'` (loading state)
4. **Routes to correct dashboard**
   - `athlete` → `/dashboard/progress`
   - `coach`/`creator`/`assistant` → `/dashboard/coach-unified`
   - `admin`/`superadmin` → `/dashboard/admin`

---

## 🔒 BULLETPROOF GUARANTEES

### ✅ No Race Conditions
- Waits for ACTUAL role from Firestore
- Never routes on `'guest'` (initial/loading state)
- Loading state explicitly shows what's pending

### ✅ No Wrong Redirects
- Individual dashboard pages have NO redirect logic
- Only `/dashboard` page makes routing decisions
- Ref-based double-redirect prevention

### ✅ Clear Debugging
Every routing decision is logged:
```
🔍 FETCHING ROLE for: user@example.com
✅ ROLE FETCHED: athlete for user@example.com
🎯 ROUTING USER: { email: 'user@example.com', role: 'athlete' }
🏃 ATHLETE DETECTED - Routing to /dashboard/progress
```

### ✅ Loading Transparency
Loading screen shows exactly what's pending:
- "Authenticating..." (while auth loads)
- "Loading role..." (while Firestore fetches role)

## 🚀 HOW TO TEST

### Test 1: Athlete Routing
```
1. Sign in as: bigpenger@gmail.com (role: athlete)
2. Navigate to: /dashboard
3. Expected: Redirects to /dashboard/progress
4. Verify: See "Athlete Dashboard" header
5. Verify: Console shows "🏃 ATHLETE DETECTED"
```

### Test 2: Coach Routing
```
1. Sign in as: joseph@crucibleanalytics.dev (role: coach)
2. Navigate to: /dashboard
3. Expected: Redirects to /dashboard/coach-unified
4. Verify: See "Coach Dashboard" header
5. Verify: Console shows "👨‍🏫 COACH/CREATOR DETECTED"
```

### Test 3: Direct URL Access
```
1. Sign in as athlete
2. Navigate directly to: /dashboard/coach-unified
3. Expected: Stays on coach-unified page (NO redirect back)
4. Note: Individual pages don't redirect - only /dashboard routes
```

## 📋 INDIVIDUAL PAGE BEHAVIOR

### `/dashboard/progress` (Athlete Dashboard)
- **NO redirect logic**
- Just renders athlete dashboard content
- Checks onboarding status
- Shows athlete-specific features

### `/dashboard/coach-unified` (Coach Dashboard)
- **NO redirect logic**
- Just renders coach dashboard content
- Shows coaching tools and athlete management
- **IMPORTANT**: The `/dashboard/creator` page has been REMOVED
- All coaches, creators, and assistants use `/dashboard/coach-unified`

### `/dashboard/admin` (Admin Dashboard)
- **NO redirect logic**
- Just renders admin dashboard content
- Shows admin tools and system management

---

## 🔧 HOW IT WAS FIXED

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Multiple places with redirect logic
// Race conditions with role loading
// Used 'guest' role in routing decisions
// Individual pages had competing redirect logic

// app/dashboard/progress/page.tsx
if (role !== 'athlete') {
  router.replace('/dashboard/coach-unified') // ❌ Race condition!
}
```

### After (Bulletproof):
```typescript
// app/dashboard/page.tsx - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
const [actualRole, setActualRole] = useState<string | null>(null)

// Fetch role directly from Firestore
const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'users', user.uid))
const role = userDoc.data()?.role

// Only route when we have REAL role
if (!actualRole || actualRole === 'guest') {
  return // Wait for real role
}

// Route based on actual role
if (actualRole === 'athlete') {
  router.replace('/dashboard/progress') // ✅ Guaranteed correct!
}

// Individual pages: NO REDIRECT LOGIC
// They just render content
```

---

## 🐛 DEBUGGING

### If Wrong Dashboard Shows:

1. **Check Console Logs**
   ```
   Look for:
   🔍 FETCHING ROLE for: [email]
   ✅ ROLE FETCHED: [role]
   🎯 ROUTING USER: { email, role }
   🏃/👨‍🏫/👑 [ROLE] DETECTED - Routing to [path]
   ```

2. **Verify Firestore Role**
   ```
   Firebase Console → Firestore
   → users collection
   → Find user by email
   → Check 'role' field
   ```

3. **Check for Errors**
   ```
   Look for:
   ❌ Error fetching role: [error]
   ⚠️ No user document found
   ⚠️ No valid role yet - waiting...
   ```

```

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

The system is working correctly when:

1. ✅ Athletes see `/dashboard/progress`
2. ✅ Coaches see `/dashboard/coach-unified`
3. ✅ Admins see `/dashboard/admin`
4. ✅ No console errors about routing
5. ✅ Console shows clear routing logs
6. ✅ Loading screen shows progress
7. ✅ Direct URL access works (no redirect loops)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Add redirect logic to individual dashboard pages
- ❌ Use 'guest' role in routing decisions
- ❌ Route before role is loaded from Firestore
- ❌ Create multiple routing logic locations
- ❌ Create links to `/dashboard/creator` (page has been removed)

### ALWAYS:
- ✅ Keep routing logic in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` ONLY
- ✅ Wait for actual role from Firestore
- ✅ Log routing decisions for debugging
- ✅ Show clear loading states
- ✅ Use `/dashboard/coach-unified` for all coach/creator/assistant navigation

---

## 📝 MAINTENANCE

### To Add New Role:
1. Update routing logic in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
2. Add role to table in this document
3. Add test scenario
4. Update flow diagram

### To Debug Routing Issues:
1. Check console logs for routing decisions
2. Verify Firestore role matches expected
3. Confirm individual pages have NO redirect logic
4. Check loading states are working
