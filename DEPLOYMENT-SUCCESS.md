**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Project:** PLAYBOOKD / GAMEPLAN
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED**

---

## Deployment Summary

**Production URL:** https://playbookd.crucibleanalytics.dev

**Deployment ID:** `6w7jQwVJV`
**Environment:** Production
**Git Commit:** `c9bc835`
**Status:** Ready ✅

---

## ✅ What Was Deployed

### 1. Firestore Indexes (13 total)
All Firestore indexes successfully deployed and enabled:

**Composite Indexes (12):**
- `users` → email + role
- `users` → role + createdAt
- `content ` → status + creatorUid + createdAt
- `content ` → creatorUid + createdAt
- `content ` → creatorUid + sport + createdAt
- `savedResponses` → userId + creatorId + savedAt
- `coach_ingestion_links` → creatorId + createdAt
- `ai_interaction_logs` → userId + timestamp
- `ai_sessions` → userId + createdAt
- `notifications` → read + createdAt (COLLECTION_GROUP)
- `auditLogs` → userId + severity + timestamp
- `auditLogs` → action + timestamp

**Single-Field Index (1):**
- `content ` → createdAt (DESC)

**Result:** All queries now use proper indexes - no more "missing index" errors!

---

**Commit message:**
```
feat: Deploy all Firestore indexes and add deployment documentation

- Fixed firestore.indexes.json (removed single-field index, fixed collection names)
- Created deploy-indexes-via-api.js for API-based index deployment
- Added comprehensive deployment documentation and checklists
- Created prevention plan and architecture decision record
- All 13 Firestore indexes now deployed and enabled

This resolves the "lessons not loading" issue by ensuring all queries have proper indexes.
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ API-based index deployment bypassed CLI bug
2. ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
3. ✅ Auto-deploy via GitHub → Vercel pipeline
4. ✅ Systematic troubleshooting approach

### Challenges Overcome
1. ⚠️ Firebase CLI `deploy --only firestore:indexes` silently failing
2. ⚠️ Collection name had trailing space (`content `)
3. ⚠️ Single-field index couldn't be in composite index file

### Improvements for Next Time
1. 💡 Set up staging environment first
2. 💡 Add error monitoring (Sentry) from day 1
3. 💡 Create automated tests for critical flows
4. 💡 Document deployment process earlier
