**Date:** January 2025

**Test Steps:**
- Open DevTools Network tab

   - `app/api/coach-invitation-simple/route.ts:33` - Validates authorization header
   - `app/api/coach/announcements/route.ts` - Uses Firebase Admin auth

2. **Token Validation Example:**
```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
if (!authHeader?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Missing or invalid authorization header' }, { status: 401 })
}
const token = authHeader.split('Bearer ')[1]
const decodedToken = await auth.verifyIdToken(token)
```

3. **No Sensitive Data in URLs:**
   - ‚úÖ Passwords sent in POST request bodies
   - ‚úÖ Tokens passed via Authorization headers
   - ‚úÖ User IDs decoded from JWT tokens, not URL parameters

**Security Verification:** All API requests use proper authentication with no exposed credentials
**No Fix Required**
