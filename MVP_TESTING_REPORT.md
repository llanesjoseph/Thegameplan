```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
if (!authHeader?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Missing or invalid authorization header' }, { status: 401 })
}
const token = authHeader.split('Bearer ')[1]
const decodedToken = await auth.verifyIdToken(token)
```

3. **No Sensitive Data in URLs:**
   - ‚úÖ Passwords sent in POST request bodies
   - ‚úÖ Tokens passed via Authorization headers
