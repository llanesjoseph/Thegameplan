**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and Ready for Customization

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

A smart placeholder system that automatically displays professional default content for coach profiles that have minimal information (no bio, no lessons, no credentials).

### When Placeholder Shows:
The placeholder view appears when a coach profile has:
- ‚ùå No bio (or bio < 50 characters)
- ‚ùå No published lessons
- ‚ùå No certifications
- ‚ùå No achievements

### Smart Stats Display:
Even when showing full profiles, empty stats now display friendly text instead of zeros:
- **Lessons:** `Coming Soon` instead of `0`
- **Athletes:** `Ready to Coach` instead of `0`
- **Rating:** `New Coach` instead of `5.0` (when no athletes yet)

1. **`components/coach/CoachProfilePlaceholder.tsx`**

### Updated Files:

## üîß How to Customize with Your HTML

You have two options for customization:

### Option 1: Replace the Entire Placeholder Component (Easiest)

Edit **`components/coach/CoachProfilePlaceholder.tsx`** and replace the return statement with your HTML.

**Example:**
```tsx
export default function CoachProfilePlaceholder({
  coachName,
  sport
}: CoachProfilePlaceholderProps) {

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* YOUR CUSTOM HTML HERE */}
      <div className="bg-white rounded-xl p-8">
        <h2>Welcome to {coachName}'s Profile</h2>
        <p>This {sport} coach is setting up their page.</p>
        {/* Add your custom design here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Option 2: Update Individual Sections

Keep the structure but customize each section individually:

**About Section:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl shadow-lg border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 p-8">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading mb-4">About</h2>
  {/* Your custom About placeholder HTML */}
</div>
```

**Specialties Section:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl shadow-lg border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 p-8">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading mb-4">Specialties</h2>
  {/* Your custom Specialties placeholder HTML */}
</div>
```

---

## üé® Using Your Specific HTML

When you're ready with your custom HTML, simply:

1. Open **`components/coach/CoachProfilePlaceholder.tsx`**
2. Replace the entire `return` statement content
3. Use the props available to you:
   - `coachName` - The coach's display name
   - `sport` - The coach's sport (e.g., "Baseball", "Basketball")

**Example with Props:**
```tsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {coachName}!</h1>
    <p>You coach {sport}. Add your bio to get started!</p>
    {/* Your HTML continues here */}
  </div>
)
```

## üéØ Design Tokens in Use

The placeholder uses your app's design system:

**Colors:**
- `#20B2AA` - Teal (primary actions)
- `#91A6EB` - Sky Blue (lessons/content)
- `#FF6B35` - Orange (achievements)
- `#E8E6D8` - Cream (backgrounds)
- `#000000` - Black (text)
- `#666666` - Gray (secondary text)

**Styling:**
- `backdrop-blur-sm` - Frosted glass effect
- `rounded-2xl` - Large rounded corners
- `shadow-lg` - Prominent shadows
- `border-dashed` - Indicates placeholder/temporary state

Feel free to use different colors or styles that match your design vision!

## üß™ Testing the Placeholder

### To See the Placeholder View:
1. Visit a coach profile page: `/coach/[coachId]`
2. The placeholder shows if the coach has:
   - No bio or very short bio (< 50 chars)
   - Zero lessons
   - No certifications
   - No achievements

### To See the Full Profile View:
The full profile displays when a coach has:
- A bio with 50+ characters, OR
- At least one published lesson, OR
- Any certifications, OR
- Any achievements

---

## üîç How It Works

**Detection Logic:**
```typescript
function isProfileMinimal(coach, totalLessons, totalAthletes): boolean {
  const hasNoBio = !coach.bio || coach.bio.trim().length < 50
  const hasNoLessons = totalLessons === 0
  const hasNoCertifications = !coach.certifications || coach.certifications.length === 0
  const hasNoAchievements = !coach.achievements || coach.achievements.length === 0

  // Show placeholder if ALL are empty
  return hasNoBio && hasNoLessons && hasNoCertifications && hasNoAchievements
}
```

**Rendering Logic (in page.tsx):**
```tsx
{isProfileMinimal(coach, totalLessons, totalAthletes) ? (
  <CoachProfilePlaceholder
    coachName={coach.displayName}
    sport={coach.sport || 'General Athletics'}
  />
) : (
  <>
    {/* Full profile sections */}
  </>
)}
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Review the current placeholder** - Visit a minimal coach profile to see it in action
2. **Prepare your HTML** - Design the exact placeholder you want
3. **Drop it in** - Replace the content in `CoachProfilePlaceholder.tsx`
4. **Test** - View a minimal profile to see your custom design
5. **Iterate** - Adjust styling/content as needed

## üí° Pro Tips

### Make It Interactive:
Add action buttons for coaches viewing their own profile:
```tsx
{isOwnProfile && (
  <button onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard/profile')}>
    Complete Your Profile ‚Üí
  </button>
)}
```

### Show Profile Completion:
Add a progress indicator:
```tsx
<div className="mb-4">
  <div className="bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
    <div className="bg-teal-500 h-2 rounded-full" style={{ width: '30%' }} />
  </div>
  <p className="text-sm mt-2">Profile 30% Complete</p>
</div>
```

### Add Personality:
Use sport-specific messages:
```tsx
{sport === 'Baseball' && (
  <p>‚öæ This baseball coach is preparing their roster...</p>
)}
```
