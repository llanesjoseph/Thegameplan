## ✨ How It Works

### Detection Logic:
Profile is "minimal" (shows placeholder) when coach has:
- ❌ No bio OR bio less than 50 characters
- ❌ Zero published lessons
- ❌ No certifications
- ❌ No achievements

### What Visitors See:
✅ **Complete-looking profile** - Looks like a real, finished profile page
✅ **Sport-specific content** - Tailored to the coach's sport
✅ **Professional appearance** - No "Coming Soon" messages
✅ **Ready to train** - Call-to-action inviting athletes to sign up

---

## 🎯 Key Differences from Before

| **Before** | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| Empty sections with "Coming Soon" | Full sections with professional content |
| Obvious placeholder appearance | Looks like a complete profile |
| Generic messages | Sport-specific, personalized content |
| No call-to-action | Prominent "Ready to Train?" section |
| Stats showing "0" | Stats showing "Coming Soon" / "Ready to Coach" |

---

## 💡 Smart Features

### 1. **Sport-Aware Specialties**
Baseball coaches don't get soccer skills - each sport gets appropriate specialties.

### 2. **Personalized Bio**
Uses the coach's actual name and sport throughout the bio.

### 3. **Professional Tone**
Sounds like a real coach wrote it, not a placeholder template.

### 4. **Training Options Display**
Shows 1-on-1, Group, and Online options to attract different types of athletes.

## 🔄 Transition to Real Content

When a coach adds real content, the profile **automatically switches** to showing:
- Their real bio (if 50+ characters)
- Their published lessons
- Their actual certifications
- Their real achievements

The placeholder **only shows** when profile is truly minimal!

---

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

All sections are fully responsive:
- Stacks beautifully on mobile
- Cards adapt to screen size
- Specialty badges wrap nicely
- Call-to-action section remains prominent

---

## 🚀 Live Now

This is **fully deployed** and working right now!

To see it in action:
1. Visit any coach profile: `/coach/[coachId]`
2. If they're a new coach with no content, you'll see the complete placeholder
3. If they have content, you'll see their real profile
