## üéì KEY LEARNINGS

**Testing Strategy:**
- Behavioral testing > Implementation testing
- Focus on "what" not "how"
- Mock external dependencies aggressively
- Test error paths as thoroughly as happy paths

**AI Testing Insights:**
- Provider fallback critical for reliability
- Token limits prevent cost overruns
- Context selection ensures quality coaching
- Response validation prevents crashes

**Infrastructure Hardening:**
- Error handling must map Firebase codes correctly
- Environment validation prevents misconfigurations
- Analytics must respect privacy (no PII)
- Audit logs must be immutable and sanitized

**Efficiency:**
- Parallel test execution saves time
- Vitest is fast (669 tests in ~15s)
- Strategic planning reduces rework
- Comprehensive mocking enables fast tests

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (Phase 10)

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
2. Configure coverage reporting with Codecov or similar
3. Add test quality gates (block merge if coverage drops)
4. Optional: Add status badges to README

**Future Maintenance:**
- Run tests before every commit
- Add tests for new features immediately
- Review coverage weekly
- Keep execution time under 30 seconds
