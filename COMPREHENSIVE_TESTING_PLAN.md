## üìù Notes & Considerations

**Challenges:**
- Firebase emulator setup may require additional configuration
- Some API routes depend on external services (may need mocking)
- Component tests may need React Testing Library setup adjustments
- Coverage of server-side code may be lower than client-side

**Best Practices:**
- Write tests BEFORE fixing bugs (TDD for bug fixes)
- Keep tests simple and focused (one assertion per test when possible)
- Use descriptive test names (should + expected behavior)
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase, Resend, OpenAI)
- Test error paths, not just happy paths

**Maintenance:**
- Run tests before every commit (`npm test`)
- Review coverage reports weekly
- Add tests for new features immediately
- Update tests when refactoring
- Keep test execution time under 5 minutes
