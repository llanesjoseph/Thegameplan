Your task is to create an exceptionally detailed, comprehensive lesson plan for ${level}-level ${sport} athletes that rivals the quality of content found in professional coaching certifications and elite training programs.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ELITE-LEVEL CONTENT:

1. LESSON STRUCTURE (4 parts with extensive detail):
   - "Warm-Up & Introduction" (8-10 minutes): Include specific movement patterns, injury prevention protocols, mental preparation
   - "Technical Instruction & Demonstration" (18-25 minutes): Detailed biomechanical breakdowns, multiple variations, troubleshooting
   - "Progressive Practice & Drilling" (15-20 minutes): Structured skill progression, partner drills, resistance training
   - "Live Application & Cool-Down" (5-8 minutes): Competition scenarios, recovery protocols, session review

2. TECHNICAL DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
   - Provide step-by-step biomechanical analysis
   - Include specific grip positions, body angles, and timing sequences
   - Detail multiple variations and adaptations
   - Explain the "why" behind each technique element
   - Include troubleshooting for 3-5 common execution errors
   - Provide specific coaching cues for each major technique component

3. PROGRESSIVE SKILL DEVELOPMENT:
   - Break complex techniques into 4-6 progressive steps
   - Include prerequisite skills and mobility requirements
   - Provide specific drilling sequences with rep counts and time intervals
   - Detail partner cooperation levels (passive, active, resistant)
   - Include assessment criteria for advancement

4. SPORT-SPECIFIC EXPERTISE FOR ${sport}:
   - Use precise technical terminology
   - Reference competition rules and scoring implications
   - Include equipment specifications and setup requirements
   - Detail safety protocols and injury prevention measures
   - Mention training methodologies specific to elite ${sport} development

5. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Specify exact timing for each drill and exercise
   - Include class size considerations and space requirements
   - Provide modification options for different skill levels
   - Detail instructor positioning and demonstration angles
   - Include specific success metrics and assessment criteria

6. ELITE COACHING ELEMENTS:
   - Include psychological and tactical considerations
   - Reference biomechanical principles and movement efficiency
   - Provide troubleshooting guides for common teaching challenges
   - Include progressive difficulty variations
   - Detail how this lesson connects to broader skill development

CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Every technique must include at least 3-4 detailed steps
- Every exercise must specify duration, repetitions, and intensity
- Every section must include specific coaching points and common mistakes
- Safety considerations must be detailed and sport-specific
- Content must be actionable enough for an instructor to teach immediately

Generate content that demonstrates deep technical expertise and coaching experience - the kind of detailed instruction that separates elite coaches from amateur instructors.`
