## Lesson Overview
This ${skillLevel}-level lesson specifically focuses on ${titleAnalysis.primaryFocus} through "${title}". As ${coachingContext.coachName}, I've designed this ${titleAnalysis.trainingType} session to develop the core skills identified in this lesson: ${titleAnalysis.keySkills.join(', ')}.

**What You'll Master:**
${titleAnalysis.keySkills.map((skill: string) => `â€¢ ${skill}`).join('\n')}

## Technical Breakdown
The key to success in this area lies in understanding the fundamental mechanics and building consistent execution through deliberate practice.

**Core Principles:**
${sportContext.skillProgression[skillLevel as keyof typeof sportContext.skillProgression].slice(0, 3).map((skill: string) => `â€¢ **${skill}**: Focus on precise execution and consistent application`).join('\n')}

## Key Fundamentals
â€¢ **Technical Precision**: Master the basic movements before adding speed or complexity
â€¢ **Mental Preparation**: Visualize successful execution before attempting
â€¢ **Progressive Development**: Build skills systematically through structured practice

## Practice Drills
1. **Foundation Drill**: Start with basic movements, focus on form over speed
2. **Progression Drill**: Add complexity gradually while maintaining technique
3. **Application Drill**: Practice in game-like situations with decision-making
